# HomeWork 18 "Workout Tracker"

## Project Description
In this project we need to create the database for a Workout Tracker using Mongo.
This project intention is for the user to be able to create her/his account and so they can track daily workouts, being able to track multiple exercises, etc.

The user should be able to:
- Add exercises to the most recent workout plan.
- Add new wxercieses to a new workout plan.
- view the combined weght of multiple exercises from the past seven workouts on the stats page.
- view the total duration of each workout from the past seven workouts on the stats page.
