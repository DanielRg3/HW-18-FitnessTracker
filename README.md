# HomeWork 18 "Workout Tracker"

## Project Description
In this project we need to create the database for a Workout Tracker using Mongo.
This project intention is for the user to be able to create her/his account and so they can track daily workouts, being able to track multiple exercises, etc.

The user should be able to:
- Add exercises to the most recent workout plan.
- Add new wxercieses to a new workout plan.
- view the combined weght of multiple exercises from the past seven workouts on the stats page.
- view the total duration of each workout from the past seven workouts on the stats page.

## Table of Content
1. Server.js (to interact between the frontend and the database)
1. Models (to define the type of information that will be displaied and required)
1. Routes (to segregate the pull and push of information to an specific webroute)
1. {The public and seeds were provided by the project}

## What I Learned
In this project I rehearced how to set up a sever.js to interact between the front end and the database. Also, how to segregate information accordin to specifics routes that will be displayed on the frontedn webpage. Also, how to code the models in order to specify the type of information that will be in exchange (determining what is a string or a number, what is required and what is optional). 

Finally, for this project it was required to use mongodb and mongoose to create the database. This is the aspect that I learned and practiced the most on this project.

It was necessary to display this app via heroku so again we practice this cloud service.
